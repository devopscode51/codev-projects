Exam #1:
    Using any configuration management tool (Puppet, Chef, Salt, Ansible, etc.), write a server configuration that would:
        1. ensure a web server is installed (Apache or NGINX),
        2. a vhost configuration file is placed,
        3. the web server is set to start at boot, and is
        4. set to always be running.
        5. BONUS: Make script portable so that it can reproduce your results in my own Linux docker container.
